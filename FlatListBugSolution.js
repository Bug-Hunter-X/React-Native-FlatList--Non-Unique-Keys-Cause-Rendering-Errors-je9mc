To solve this, use a unique identifier for each item in your data, such as a database ID or UUID. 

```javascript
//Correct Usage
<FlatList
  data={myData}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text key={item.id}>{item.text}</Text>}
/>

```

Ensure that the `id` property is unique for every item within `myData`.  If your data source doesn't provide unique IDs, generate them before rendering the list.

```javascript
const myDataWithIds = myData.map((item, index) => ({...item, id: uuid()}));
```
Where `uuid()` is a function that generates UUIDs (universally unique identifiers) - you can install a package such as `uuid` via npm (`npm install uuid`).
