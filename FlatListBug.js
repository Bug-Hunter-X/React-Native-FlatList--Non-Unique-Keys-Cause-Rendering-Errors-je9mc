This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an invalid key prop to the items being rendered.  The key prop should be a unique identifier for each item in the data array. If the keys are not unique, React Native may not be able to efficiently update the list, leading to unexpected behavior, crashes or incorrect rendering.  For example, if you are using an index as the key, and items are added or removed from the array, updates can be slow and incorrect.

```javascript
//Incorrect Usage
<FlatList
  data={myData}
  renderItem={({ item, index }) => <Text key={index}>{item.text}</Text>}
/>

```
